Hi, I'm Raphael RUssell
I'm interested in... well I'm not too sure. I'm just a Bachelor of Computer Science undergrad
I'm currently learning base c/c++ in Visual Studio
I'm looking to collaberate on anything that really takes my interest... I'll need to check this site out first really, and then see if I ahve enough time to do something like that.
